        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>
          This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Mobile Application
          Developer ("Mobile Application Developer", "we", "us" or "our")
          collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information
          ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in
          the Eaterin mobile application and any of its products or services
          (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services"). It also describes
          the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal
          Information and how you can access and update this information. This
          Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own
          or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
        <p>
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
          you create an account, fill any online forms in the Mobile
          Application. When required this information may include your email
          address, name, phone number, or other Personal Information. You can
          choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may
          not be able to take advantage of some of the Mobile Application's
          features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory
          are welcome to contact us.
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of non-personal information</h3>
        <p>
          When you open the Mobile Application our servers automatically record
          information that your device sends. This data may include information
          such as your device's IP address and location, device name and
          version, operating system type and version, language preferences,
          information you search for in our Mobile Application, access times and
          dates, and other statistics.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing personal information</h3>
        <p>
          You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal
          Information about you. The information you can view, update, and
          delete may change as the Mobile Application or Services change. When
          you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the
          unrevised information in our records. Some information may remain in
          our private records after your deletion of such information from your
          account. We will retain and use your information as necessary to
          comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
          agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or
          incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
          but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the
          retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after the expiration of the retention period.
        </p>
        <h3>Use of collected information</h3>
        <p>
          Any of the information we collect from you may be used to improve
          customer service and respond to queries and emails of our customers;
          send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; run
          and operate our Mobile Application and Services. The information you
          provide may also be shared with our partnering restaurants for the
          purpose of the reservation as well as follow ups with regards to the
          reservation. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to
          identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
          information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage. This
          statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that
          would identify any particular user of the system.

        <p>
          In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile
          Application has been compromised or users Personal Information has
          been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external
          activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we

          but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
          notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In
          the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify
          affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of
          harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
          required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Mobile
          Application and send you an email.

          required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or
